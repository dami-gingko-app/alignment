# Alignment coding challenge

### Introduction
This project is a simple DNA alignment web application. The back-end has been written in Java 8, and the front-end is in Angular 9.
Users can submit any DNA sequence(consisting of 'A','T','G' and 'C's), and the application will parse over the protein sequences in a
provided list of assemblies to find a match.
